Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.57.1

ESLint couldn't find a configuration file. To set up a configuration file for this project, please run:

    npm init @eslint/config

ESLint looked for configuration files in /Users/self/Desktop/Projects/EcoTail/packages/backend/src/config and its ancestors. If it found none, it then looked in your home directory.

If you think you already have a configuration file or if you need more help, please stop by the ESLint Discord server: https://eslint.org/chat
